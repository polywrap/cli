**Polywrap** is a framework for developing software powered by Wraps. Wraps are software modules that are:
* **Portable** - run in any environment
* **Composable** - easily and safely call into one another

We believe that the future of software will be driven by a multitude of highly-specialized, platform-agnostic modules rather than monoliths.
