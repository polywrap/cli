# Contributing

The Polywrap project is completely open-source and we welcome contributors of all levels.

Come visit our [Github issues](https://github.com/polywrap/monorepo/issues) to see the problems we're focused on solving. Here are some of our tags for issues and what they mean:

- `good first issue` - These are good first issues for newcomers to learn about how our project works

- `pri-0`, `pri-1` and `pri-2` - These are our priority issues, with `pri-0` being our highest priority and `pri-2` being lower.

- `alpha-blocker` - We're in pre-alpha right now and to get to alpha, we need to resolve all alpha blocker issues

- `beta-blocker` - After our alpha release, we'll start working towards releasing our beta! These are the blockers for us in reaching that milestone.
