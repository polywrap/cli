# Polywrap Origin (0.9.0)
## Features
* [PR-1306](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1306) `polywrap` CLI: Console logging has been improved, and all commands now support `-q, --quiet` and `-v, --verbose` options.
* [PR-1204](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1204) `polywrap` CLI: **Build times are faster for wasm wrappers!!!** The `build` command has been updated to include the concept of "build strategies". The existing way of building (via `Dockerfile` image layers) is available through the `polywrap build --strategy image` command. Building without Docker (if all build-time dependencies are installed locally) can be performed using `--strategy local`. And lastly, the new default build strategy is `--strategy vm`, which runs all build steps in a pre-built base image, allowing for near-local speeds (once the image has been downloaded).
  * NOTE: `--strategy image` is useful for source-code verification, something we'll be better supporting in the future.
* [PR-1297](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1297) `@polywrap/schema-bind`: `wasm/rust` now has support for `println!(...)` and `print!(...)` macros. They have been redefined to use the `polywrap_wasm_rs::wrap_debug_log(...)` function.

```
Usage: polywrap manifest|m [options] [command]
Inspect & Migrade Polywrap Manifests
Options:
  -h, --help                  display help for command
Commands:
  schema|s [options] [type]   Prints out the schema for the current manifest format.
  migrate|m [options] [type]  Migrates the polywrap project manifest to the latest version.
  help [command]              display help for command
```
  * [PR-1301](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1301) Added a `--format` option to the `migrate` command, enabling the targeting of specific format versions when migrating manifests (ex: `polywrap manifest migrate -f 0.2.0`).
* [PR-1218](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1218) `polywrap` CLI, `@polywrap/tracing-js`: The `tracing` infrastructure module (i.e. `polywrap infra up --modules tracing`) now uses version `0.11.0` of the `SizNoz` tracing service. Additionally the underlying `@polywrap/tracing-js` library has been updated to support this, and also now has named traces via the `traceName` configuration property.

* [PR-1296](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1296) `polywrap` CLI: The `polywrap.app.yaml` and `polywrap.plugin.yaml` project manifest file names are being deprecated in favor of a unified `polywrap.yaml` file for all types of projects (wasm, interface, plugin, app). They will still silently work now, but in the future will no longer be recognized defaults.
* [PR-1303](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1303) `@polywrap/core-js`: The `Uri` class now properly formats itself when being `JSON.stringify(...)`'d.
* [PR-1288](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1288) `@polywrap/core-js`: Correctly handle errors in the `getImplementations` algorithm.
* [PR-1298](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1298) `@polywrap/ipfs-plugin-js`, `@polywrap/ipfs-resolver-plugin-js`: Remove the use of `require(...)` statements.
* [PR-1286](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1286) `@polywrap/polywrap-manifest-types-js`: Manifest migration logic has been upgraded to use a strategy that finds a "shortest path" between the `from` and `to` format versions, using predefined migration functions.

* [PR-1192](https://github.com/polywrap/toolchain/pull/1192) `@polywrap/client-js`: `PolywrapClient.invoke(...)` no longer accepts invoke-time reconfiguration via the `config` property. Users who wish to reconfigure the client can do so by calling `client.getConfig()`, modifying it via the `ClientConfigBuilder`, and constructing a new `PolywrapClient` instance.

```
to
```typescript
generateBinding = (

* `@web3api/schema-parse`: Duplicate fields on object & query types are not detected, and will cause a compiler error.

## Breaking Changes
* `@web3api/client-js`: Removed the `loadWeb3Api(...)` method from the client. This is because we do not want to give the user of the client a direct reference to the underlying API class object. Since garbage collection will delete these, having the user able to hang onto references, will result in them staying in memory.

# Web3API 0.0.1-prealpha.39

## Bugs
* `@web3api/schema-bind`: Fix TypeScript plugin enum bindings.

# Web3API 0.0.1-prealpha.34

# Web3API 0.0.1-prealpha.32
## Features
* Improved the plugin developer experience by creating a new `w3 plugin codegen` command, which generated types based on the plugin's schema. For an example of how this works, see the updated plugin template project by running `w3 create plugin typescript my-plugin`.
* `@web3api/cli`: Refactored the `w3 codegen` command, making its default behavior the generation of types for Web3APIs. It's "old" behavior of loading a custom generation script is now usable through the `--custom` option.

* `@web3api/graph-node-plugin-js`: Finalized the graph-node plugin implementation, added e2e tests. It currently only works with the hosted service.

## Bugs
* Removed support for UInt64 & Int64 base types. More info [here](https://github.com/polywrap/monorepo/pull/414).
* `@web3api/cli`: Properly validate all required exports from Web3API Wasm modules at compile-time.
* `@web3api/ethereum-plugin-js`: Properly support smart contract methods with structures as arguments.
